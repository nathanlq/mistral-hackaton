## **7. Problem Statement**

In this Hackathon, your task is to create one or more MCP servers and integrate them into Le Chat. Your MCP(s) should work together to produce a cohesive and innovative solution.

There are no limitations on the domain. You may choose any subject area you find relevant, such as:

- Development tools

- Productivity tools

- Video games

- Creativity

- Psychology

- Education

- Or any other field that inspires you

The goal is to push the boundaries of Le Chat by leveraging external tools. Before starting, ask yourself:

**|** Can I already do this natively in Le Chat?

If the answer is no, you are off to a good start.

## **8. Example Projects**

**a. Personal Application Tracker**

Leverage Le Chat‚Äôs OCR capabilities to analyze your resume and automatically scan job platforms (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.) for relevant opportunities.¬†

The MCP could:

- Find relevant jobs based on your skillset.

- Apply to jobs on your behalf by filling out forms.

- Track applications in a structured spreadsheet (e.g., Google Sheets)

\
**b. Le Chat as a Dungeon Master for D&D**¬†

Transform Le Chat into a multiplayer game master for Dungeons & Dragons.

¬†The MCP could:

- Manage character sheets and game state for all players.

- Simulate dice rolls and resolve in-game effects.

- Enable real-time collaboration, allowing players to interact through Le Chat as if they were around a physical table.

**c. Interactive Language Learning Companion**¬†

Build an MCP that transforms Le Chat into a personalized language tutor

¬†The MCP could:

- Uses speech recognition and OCR to correct pronunciation and grammar in real time.

- Generates custom quizzes and flashcards based on the user‚Äôs progress.

- Simulates conversations with AI characters (e.g., ordering food in a virtual caf√©).

- Tracks fluency milestones and suggests cultural content (movies, articles) to reinforce learning.

## **9. CV x Mistral Previous Winning Projects**

[**Le CopyChat**](https://devpost.com/software/le-copychat)**:** Le CopyChat revolutionizes how robots learn by enabling them to mimic tasks demonstrated by humans through simple video footage, such as YouTube clips.
